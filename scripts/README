# Scripts Directory

This directory contains all TCL and shell scripts for running the design flow.

## Main Scripts

### Simulation Scripts
- **simulation.tcl** - Logic simulation script for Cadence Xcelium
- **run_sim.sh** - Shell script wrapper for running simulations
- **backannotation.tcl** - SDF back-annotation simulation script

### Synthesis Scripts
- **genus.tcl** - Logic synthesis script for Cadence Genus
- **settings.tcl** - Common settings and configurations
- **procedures.tcl** - Helper procedures for Cadence tools (provided by course)

### Power Analysis Scripts
- **voltus.post_synth.tcl** - Power estimation using Cadence Voltus

### Simulation Options
- **xrun_options.glv** - Gate-level verification options
- **xrun_options.backannotation** - Back-annotation simulation options

## Usage

### Running RTL Simulation
```bash
cd scripts
./run_sim.sh
```

### Running Synthesis
```tcl
# From Cadence Genus
source genus.tcl
```

### Running Power Analysis
```tcl
# From Cadence Voltus
source voltus.post_synth.tcl
```

## Notes

- `procedures.tcl` is provided by the course (ENICS) and should not be modified
- Scripts expect the project structure as defined in the main README
- Refer to the [main documentation](../README.md) for detailed usage instructions
