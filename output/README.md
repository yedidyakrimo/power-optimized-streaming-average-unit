# Output Directory

This directory contains reference output files and simulation results.

## Contents

### Reference Files
- **exp_output.ref.txt** - Expected reference output for validation
- **sum_output.txt** - Output from accumulator module simulation

## Usage

These files are used to:
- Validate simulation results against expected outputs
- Compare RTL simulation with gate-level simulation
- Verify functional correctness of the design

## Notes

- Output files from simulations may be generated in this directory
- Compare your simulation results with the reference files
- Do not modify reference files as they are used for validation
