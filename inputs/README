# Inputs Directory

This directory contains all design inputs and constraints for synthesis and simulation (excluding RTL source code).

## Contents

### Design Constraints
- **average.sdc** - Synopsys Design Constraints for timing
- **dut.sdc** - Device Under Test constraints
- **average.dut.defines** - Combined design definitions

### Design Definitions
- **average.defines** - Design-specific definitions
- **dut.defines** - General DUT definitions
- **voltus.defines** - Power analysis definitions

### Library Definitions
Technology library setup files:
- **libraries.TSMC65LP.tcl** - TSMC 65nm Low Power library
- **libraries.ARM65LP_SC.tcl** - ARM standard cell library
- **libraries.ARM65LP_SRAM.tcl** - ARM SRAM library
- **libraries.TSMC65_IO.tcl** - TSMC I/O library

## Usage

These files are sourced by synthesis and simulation scripts in the `scripts/` directory. They define:
- Timing constraints (clock period, input/output delays)
- Design parameters (data width, timeout values)
- Library paths and operating conditions
- Technology-specific settings

**Note:** Proprietary library files (`.lib`, `.db`, `.lef`) are not included in this repository.
